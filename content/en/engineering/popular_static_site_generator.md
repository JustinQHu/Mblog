## Static Site Generator

Choosing the right [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)(SSGs) from the wide range of options available for technical writing can be daunting, whether it's for blogs, personal websites, or open-source project documentation.

Over the years, I've used multiple static site generators, primarily for my website. I started with writing on blogging platforms and gradually transitioned to a self-hosted and self-managed approach. Initially, I utilized dynamic website solutions like [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress), then moved on to static site generators like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and ultimately [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Recently, I came across a few project documentation sites built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which sparked my interest in writing a summary and a comparative breakdown of these popular static site generators on the market.

It’s not surprising that there are outstanding articles discussing the differences among some of the most popular static site generators: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Furthermore, tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Grok](https://grok.com/?referrer=website), and [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) simplify the process of writing this article even more.

## Takeaways

1. Choose the best SSG tool that fits your project requirements and your team’s expertise.
2. Unintentionally, this post has become more like an LLM comparison than a static site generator comparison.
3. LLM tools like ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek have made writing and image generation much easier. (This article is a perfect example)
4. LLM tools fundamentally changed how people get information from the internet, drastically reducing the need for search. (Bad news for Google who dominates the search market)
5. Grok has the most comprehensive, to some extent even verbose, answer to this specific question; whereas ChatGPT and DeepSeek offer a more concise one.
6. Grok has the worst [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) support. I need to manually add all Markdown formatting, which is tedious, especially for those tables. Answers from ChatGPT and DeepSeek can be directly copied and pasted to a Markdown file.
