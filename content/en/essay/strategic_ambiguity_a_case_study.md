## Strategic Ambiguity

We may often hear the term **Strategic Ambiguity** (also known as **deliberate ambiguity** or **strategic uncertainty**)in 
politics and foreign relationships.

Traditional notion of strategic ambiguity only applies to politics and foreign affairs is incomplete and misleading to 
some extent.  This article takes a deep look into the usage of strategic ambiguity in 3 different areas:  music,  foreign
affairs, and communication and hope to shed some light to the topic.

## Deliberate Ambiguity in Music Industry

[Lauren Daigle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Daigle) probably is one of the most iconic and successful 
contemporary Christian singers.  Her songs often hit Billboard top trending, and she has won multiple Grammy Awards for her music.  

The question is how can a Gospel singer, like Lauren Daigle,  get millions of plays and views in an increasingly secular
and atheist world? The answer is strategic ambiguity.  Her songs are intentionally ambiguous and subject to different
interpretations,  both secular and religious.  

For instance,  her [Grammy-winning](https://www.grammy.com/artists/lauren-daigle/18968) song [Thank God I Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfR6XLXRNy0) can be interpreted as talking to God or someone who she loves. 
As a result,  this song can be viewed both as Christian music or secular pop music,  which makes the song acceptable to
millions of non-religious listeners.


```shell
I've seen love come and
I've seen love walk away
So many questions
Will anybody stay?
It's been a hard year
So many nights in tears
All of the darkness
Trying to fight my fears
Alone, so long alone
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know You
I'd probably fall off the edge
I don't know where I'd go if You ever let go
So keep me held in Your hands
I've started breathing
The weight is lifted here
With You, it's easy
My head is finally clear
There's nothing missing
When You are by my side
I took the long road
But now I realize
I'm home with You, I'm home
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know You
I'd probably fall off the edge
I don't know where I'd go if You ever let go
So keep me held in Your hands
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know You
I'd probably fall off the edge
I don't know where I'd go if You ever let go
So keep me held in Your hands
You're my safe place
My hideaway
You're my anchor
My saving grace
You're my constant
My steadiness
You're my shelter
My oxygen
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know You
Thank God, I do
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know You
I'd probably fall off the edge
I don't know where I'd go if You ever let go
So keep me held in Your hands
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know You
Thank God, I do
```

The same pattern of **strategic ambiguity** can be found in her other hit songs like [You Say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_49NQI3XTQ),
[Rescue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYR0xP1j4PY), [Trust in You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_aVFVveJNs), and others. 

This article is not to judge whether Christian songs should or should not explicit refer to God,  but just to offer the
observation of how strategic ambiguity can be successfully employed in the music industry.  Again,  this article is not
to make a moral judgement on the approach taken by Lauren Daigle,  but leverage her as an example illustrating how ambiguity
can be an effective strategy in the music industry.
