The [Kawartha Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawartha_Lakes_(Ontario)) are a chain of lakes (about 18 - 25 lakes) in south-central Ontario. [The city of Kawartha Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawartha_Lakes) is named for them, but more than half of the Kawartha Lakes are located in [Peterborough County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterborough_County). The [Trent-Severn Waterway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent%E2%80%93Severn_Waterway) makes it way through many lakes. Together with the Kawartha Conservation, which is located in the [Ken Reid Conservation Area](https://www.kawarthaconservation.com/conservation-areas/ken-reid-conservation-area/), they make a great destination for a brief escape from the city, especially in the summer.

[Lindsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay,_Ontario) is a small community on the [Scugog River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scugog_River) located in the City of Kawartha Lakes. It's weirdly popular as a driver's license exam destination among some new immigrants, as it has a county highway with a maximum speed of 80 km/h, making it easier to pass. In contrast, the 400s highways have a 100 km/h limit and way more traffic.
