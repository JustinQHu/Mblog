## Algonquin Provincial Park

[Algonquin Provincial Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Provincial_Park) is Ontario’s oldest provincial park which was established in 1893.

It has an astonishing size of 7,653 km2, making it larger than Canada’s smallest province: [Prince Edward Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island) (5660 km2). It’s also about the same size as the US states of [Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware) and [Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island) combined, according to this [FAQ](https://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/general_park_info/faqs.php#:~:text=Q%3A%20How%20big%20is%20Algonquin,(1%2C045%20square%20miles)%20combined.) on the park’s official website.

## Algonquin Logging Museum

Algonquin has about 200 years of history of logging. It started as a logging destination and later expanded to recreational usage as a provincial park. Logging before the modern invention of mechanic saw and truck was a hard job and many people died logging in Algonquin. The Algonquin Logging Museum,  which is a lovely outdoor trail,  explains the history of logging in Algonquin and it's 200 year's evolution and development.
