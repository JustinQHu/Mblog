[Niagara Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls,_Ontario) is a popular tourism destination in the Greater Toronto Area and Canada, especially in summer. This post offers the unique views of Niagara Falls in winter times, whereas a previous post [Niagara Falls](/travel/niagara_falls/) explores the beauty it provides during summer.

The [Niagara Parks Butterfly Conservatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Parks_Butterfly_Conservatory) operated by the Niagara Parks Commissions was opened in December 1996. It has over 2,000 tropical butterflies from over 45 different species. Some useful knowledge I learned after the visit is that you should wear bright clothes, move slowly, and wear perfume or cologne if you want butterflies to land on you.
