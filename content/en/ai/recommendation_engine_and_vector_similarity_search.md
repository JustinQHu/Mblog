## Recommendation Engine Overview

We are quite used to the existing of various recomendation systems in modern life.  For example, video streaming platform like Youtube use recommendation engine to recommend video feed to you,  social media platforms like Instagram and X also have their recommendation algorithms to recomend new content to you,  and e-commerce sites like Amazon would recommend products to to use to boost sales and so on.

The basic idea behind recommendation systems is quite simple:  recommend similar products or content to the item you already purcharsed or liked.  As a result,  you will potentialy buy more products or watching more content,  leading to a higher profit for the company.

## The Implementation

Although the basic idea of any recommendation algorithm is simple and straightforward, it's not that easy to translate it into code.

It's quite easy to implement an recommendation engine,  but it was built upon almost a decade building effort fromt the tech industry.

To sum up, the following steps are needed to build a recommendation system:
>
>1. Derive mathmatic or programtic representation of the target
>2. Define a similarity or closeness metric
>3. Calculate the similatiries for all items, and return the top N
