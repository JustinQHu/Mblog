## Intro

It's unsurprising that people a lot of times need to attend dozends or even more different tasks simultanenously in this fast-paced world at a given period of time.

Technologies have exacerbated the situation with the invention of instant messaging(e.g. Slack,  Teams, and WebEx). The expectations in corporate world has changed from  and a few hours of response time for dozens of emails to dozens of minutes of response time for thousands of instance messages.

Such situation is quite ***distracting, exhuasting, and counterproductive*** and we need to find better ways to cope with it.

This post is about how to prioritize tasks using the Imporance and Urgency Matrix,  and how to use them to evalute job to determine if it's a long-term sustainable one.

## Prioritization Based on Importantce and Urgency Matrix

### Basic Idea

>1. **Important Tasks** : Things that have long-term effect on the goals, values, and mission. Typically, these are not urgent and people are calm, open, and rational dealing them.
>2. **Urgent Task** : Activities that require people's immediate attention.  They put people in a reactive mode - a defensive, hurried, and narrowly-focused state.

The definition of **Importance** can vary from people to people and from team to team. What's important to a person can be trivial to another person, and what's important in people's 20s is totally different from that of their 30s. Some soul searching work needs to be done to gain clarity on what's trully important to you.

### The Matrix

General rule:  
>
>1. Handle important and urgent stuff first
>2. Schedule and reserve time for important and not urgent things
>3. Delegate urgent but not important activities as much as possible
>4. Push not important and not urgent tasks to the bottone of the priority list  

For people who are not in the position(e.g. management or leader) to delegate tasks to other people, urgent activities (category 1 & 3) will need to be handled first.

## Evalute the Job

Intereating enough,  the same Importantce and Urgency matrix can also be applied to evalute the job to see if it's contributing to the realization of your long-term goals, values, and missiosn, to determine if this job is long-term fit.

A good job should leave you some time to do important but nor urgent stuff.  If most of the your time is spent on urgent activties trying to put out fire leaving you no time for important and nonurgent activities, then the job is not beneficial and sustainable to you long-term. Probably a job change is needed in such situation.
