## Intro

It's unsurprising that people a lot of times need to attend dozends or even more different tasks in this fast-paced world at a given period of time.

Technologies have exacerbated the situation with the invention of instant messaging(e.g. Slack,  Teams, and WebEx). The expectations in corporate world has changed from dozens of emails and a few hours at least response time to thousands of instance messages and on more than an hour of reponse time.

Such situation is quite distracting, exhuasting, and counterproductive and we need to find better ways to cope with it.

This post is about how to prioritize tasks using Imporance and Urgency as the critieria,  and how to use them to evalute job to determine if it's a long-term sustainable one.

## Prioritization Based on Importantce and Urgency 

### Basic Idea
>1. Important Tasks :things that have long-term effect on your the goals, values, and mission. Typically, these are not urgent and people are calm, open, and rational dealing them.

> 2. Urgent Task:  activities that require our immediate attention.  They put people in a reactive mode - a defensive, hurried, and narrowly-focused state.

### The Matrix

General rule:  
>
>1. handle important and urgent stuff first
>2. schedule and reserve time for important and not urgent things
>3. delegate urgent but not important activities as much as possible
>4. push not important and not urgent tasks to the bottone of the priority

## Evalute the Job

Intereating enough,  the same matrix can also be applied to evalute the job to see if it's contributing to achiving your long-term goals, values, and missiosn, to determine if this job is long-term sustainable.

A good job should leave you some time to do important but nor urgent stuff.  If most of the your time is spent on urgent activties trying to put off fire , and you seldom have time for imporant yet not urgent activities,   then the job is not beneficial and sustainable to you long-term.
