## Montreal 

[Montreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal) is located by the riverside of the [St. Lawrence River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_River) and is the second 
most populous city in Canada. Of course,  French is the city's official language. 

General Impressions:
> 1. Downtown Montreal is built on hills; so a lot of uphills and downhills while wandering around in the city center;
> 2. Montreal gives people a feeling of cleanness; the homeless issue is less severe compared to other major cities like Toronto and Ottawa;
> 3. There are a lot of stunningly beautiful churches in the city;
> 4. Unlike Ontario,  vehicles in Montreal only have a rear plate;
> 5. A lot of pedestrians don't follow traffic lights when crossing the roads;
> 6. [Saint-Catherine St](https://www.mtl.org/en/what-to-do/heritage-and-architecture/sainte-catherine-street) is a pedestrian-only street with tons of shops, bars and restaurants;
