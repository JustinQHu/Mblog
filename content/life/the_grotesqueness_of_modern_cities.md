# The Grotesqueness of Modern Cities

## Boring and Plainness of Modern Cities 

I often feel modern cities  not beautiful, sometimes even ugly. 

I held such feelings while I was in China.  At that time, I thought it was understandable 
that China doesn't possess many classical and beautiful buildings, given most old buildings in China used 
wood and were vulnerable to fires. Not to mention the intensional demolish old buildings during the Cultural Revolution. 

I was expecting something different from Canada, but was quite disappointed by harsh realities. 

From an architectural perspective, Toronto is nothing but a similar replica of cities in China: skyscrapers after
skyscrapers, office buildings after office buildings. 

## A Harsh Example

One thing I dislike about York University is its plain and ugly campus, especially when compared to 
University of Toronto. 

All buildings at York University are typical modern and postmodern styles.
