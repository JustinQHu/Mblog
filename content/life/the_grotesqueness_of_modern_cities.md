# The Grotesqueness of Modern Cities

## Boring and Plainness of Modern Cities 

I often feel modern cities  not beautiful, sometimes even ugly. 

I held such feelings while I was in China.  At that time, I thought it was understandable 
that China doesn't possess many classical and beautiful buildings, given most old buildings in China used 
wood and were vulnerable to fires. Not to mention the intensional demolish old buildings during the Cultural Revolution. 

I was expecting something different from Canada, but was quite disappointed by harsh realities. 

From an architectural perspective, Toronto is nothing but a similar replica of cities in China: skyscrapers after
skyscrapers, office buildings after office buildings. 

## A Harsh Comparison 

### York University
One thing I dislike about York University is its plain and ugly campus, especially when compared to 
University of Toronto.

As shown in images,  all buildings at York University are typical modern and postmodern styles.

### University of Toronto
On the contrary,  University of Toronto has some of the most beautiful architectures in Toronto.

University of Toronto possesses some very classical buildings, some Renaissance and neoclassical buildings.

Of course, one sad thing about University of Toronto is that their new campus is very typical modern and postmodern style 
and doesn't have the same beauty anymore.


## The Missing Value of Beauty

The problem with modern cities and buildings lies in the underlying philosophy of Modernism, which emphasizes that form 
should follow function, embraces functionalism and minimalism, and rejects ornament.

Modern cities are built upon such Modernism idea and naturally lacks the focus of beauty in architectures. 

While some may find modern building convenient and even attractive, I firmly believe there is value in beauty itself. I prefer
buildings with both functional and artistic values.
