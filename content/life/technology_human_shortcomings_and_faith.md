[Billy Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham) probably is the greatest evangelist of the 20th century, 
and his teaching is ever-lasting, timeless, and of fundamental truth. I am so glad our world had such a great preacher 
like Billy Graham, a living proof of God' grace and glory. 


Speaking at TED in 1998, Billy Graham discussed the power of modern technologies to improve lives but 
pointed out three problems technology canâ€™t solve:
>Human evil, suffering, and death.


In the end, only Jesus Christ can save humanity from those shortcomings.
