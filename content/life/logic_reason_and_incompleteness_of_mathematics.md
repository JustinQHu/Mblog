The name of this website comes from book: *Logicomix: an Epic Search for Truth*. 

This article is more or less a review of the book.

Logicomix is a graphic novel(or a comic book) depicting the life of the renowned British mathematician, philosopher, logician,
writer, and public intellectual Bertrand Russell, particularly Russell's quest for fundamental and absolute truth
by trying to establish a new rigid and provable foundation for mathematics. 

A bunch of interesting ideas are being discussed in the book.


## The Quest of First Axioms and Principles

Russell considers the whole subject of mathematics, which dates all the way back to Ancient greek,
to be a house built on sand, a house without solid foundation. Russell thinks that all human's mathematical
knowledge are unreliable because they are derived from axioms and postulates, which are considered
to be true but haven't been proved mathematically. 

For instance,  Euclid, who is the father of geometry,  builds this branch of mathematics on axioms and postulates.

Euclid's Axioms
> 1. Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another
> 2. If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equals.
> 3. If equals be subtracted from equals, the reminders are equals.
> 4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another
> 5. The whole is greater than the part

Euclid's Postulates
> 1. To draw a straight line from any point ot point.
> 2. To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.
> 3. To describe a circle with any center and distance.
> 4. That all right angles are equal to one another. 
> 5. That if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same 
> side less than two right angles, the straight lines, if produced indefinitely, will meet on that side
> on which the angles are less that two right angles.
