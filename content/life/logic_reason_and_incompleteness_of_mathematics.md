A fun fact is that the name of this website comes from the book: [*Logicomix: an Epic Search for Truth*](https://www.amazon.ca/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521). 

This article is more or less a review of the book.

Logicomix is a graphic novel(or a comic book) depicting the life of the renowned British mathematician, philosopher, logician,
writer, and public intellectual [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell), particularly Russell's quest for fundamental and absolute truth
by attempting to establish a new rigid and provable foundation for mathematics. 

The book discusses a bunch of intriguing ideas.


## The Quest of Solid Foundations

Russell considers the whole subject of mathematics, which dates back to Ancient greek,
to be a house built on sand, a home without a solid foundation. Russell thinks that all human mathematical
knowledge is unreliable because they are derived from ***axioms*** and ***postulates***, ***self-evident*** and true but haven't been proved mathematically. 

For instance, [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid), the father of geometry, builds this branch of mathematics upon axioms and postulates.

Euclid's Axioms
> 1. Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another
> 2. If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equals.
> 3. If equals be subtracted from equals, the reminders are equals.
> 4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another
> 5. The whole is greater than the part

Euclid's Postulates
> 1. To draw a straight line from any point to point.
> 2. To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.
> 3. To describe a circle with any center and distance.
> 4. That all right angles are equal to one another. 
> 5. That if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same 
> side less than two right angles, the straight lines, if produced indefinitely, will meet on that side
> on which the angles are less that two right angles.

Therefore, Russell describes the foundation of mathematics as a **Shaky World Turtle**, as illustrated in the image:

In his decade-long search for a solid foundation in mathematics,  Russell completed [*The Principles of Mathematics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics)
and [*Principia Mathematica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica), during which He started to **realize intuitively** that 
>It's an endless journey to pursue a solid foundation in math because new axioms need to be introduced to prove an existing axiom. 
>The process goes on and on, never stopping!

As depicted vividly by the following image:

## The Incompleteness of Mathematics

Although Russell had an intuitive realization that it's impossible to get rid of axioms and have a rock-solid foundation for math, 
it was another mathematical genius [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) proved mathematically that 
>There will always be unanswerable questions and unprovable statements; 
> therefore, arithmetic, and thus any system based on it, is, of necessity, incomplete. 

The finding is called **Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem**. Combined with his **Second Incompleteness Theorem**, Gödel proved mathematically
> the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories.

Russell's intuition and Godel's Incompleteness theory confirm one vital point:  there will always be unknown 
and unanswerable questions in mathematical systems and in science and technology built upon mathematics, 
resonating with [Billy Graham's idea that technology can't solve human shortcomings as well](/life/technology_human_shortcomings_and_faith/).

## Pacifism

Russell is a pacifist and an opponent of violence of any kind, primarily due to his close encounter with the consequence of wars as a kid. 

The public heavily criticized him and even [imprisoned](https://www.nytimes.com/1961/09/13/archives/bertrand-russell-jailed-over-atom-protest-writer-89-and-wife-get.html) him for this.  

Russell's situation is quite relatable to us in 2022, with the raging war between Russia and Ukraine and pacifist people, including [Elon Musk](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2022/10/05/elon-musk-offered-a-solution-to-ending-the-ukraine-war-on-twitter--is-social-media-the-place-to-shape-a-countrys-future/?sh=3842b97a4eba), being attacked and criticized.

I am not in any position to judge, but I just find it very interesting that:

> People are generally against war when they have encountered the outcomes of battles, directly or indirectly.  
> Newer generations tend to be subject to nationalistic or other ideological influences and long for wars.  
> History witnesses the weird cycle of generations of pro and against wars.



## Logic and First Principle Thinking

What is logic?
> Logic is new and necessary reasoning!

How should we view and approach logic? 
> Logic is an essential and powerful tool of human minds.   
> Meanwhile, we should be aware of the limitation of such tools and the finity of science and technology.    
> Then, use logic, like other tools in life, to make life better.


First principle thinking
> With logic, we can reason through first principles for vital questions.
