Fun fact: the name of this website comes from the book: *Logicomix: an Epic Search for Truth*. 

This article is more or less a review of the book.

Logicomix is a graphic novel(or a comic book) depicting the life of the renowned British mathematician, philosopher, logician,
writer, and public intellectual Bertrand Russell, particularly Russell's quest for fundamental and absolute truth
by attempting to establish a new rigid and provable foundation for mathematics. 

A bunch of interesting ideas are being discussed in the book.


## The Quest of First Axioms and Principles

Russell considers the whole subject of mathematics, which dates all the way back to Ancient greek,
to be a house built on sand, a house without solid foundation. Russell thinks that all human's mathematical
knowledge are unreliable because they are derived from axioms and postulates, which are considered
to be self-evident and true but haven't been proved mathematically. 

For instance, Euclid, who is the father of geometry, builds this branch of mathematics on axioms and postulates.

Euclid's Axioms
> 1. Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another
> 2. If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equals.
> 3. If equals be subtracted from equals, the reminders are equals.
> 4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another
> 5. The whole is greater than the part

Euclid's Postulates
> 1. To draw a straight line from any point ot point.
> 2. To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.
> 3. To describe a circle with any center and distance.
> 4. That all right angles are equal to one another. 
> 5. That if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same 
> side less than two right angles, the straight lines, if produced indefinitely, will meet on that side
> on which the angles are less that two right angles.

Russell describes the foundation of mathematics with **World Turtle**, as illustrated in the image:

In over a decade long search of a solid foundation of mathematics,  Russell completed *The Principles of Mathematics*
and *Principia Mathematicia*, during which He starts to realize intuitively that 
>Tt is an endless journey to pursue a solid foundation of math, because to prove an axiom, new axioms need to be introduced. 
>The process goes on and on, never stopping!

As depicted vividly by the following image:

## The Incompleteness of Mathematics
Although Russell had an intuitive feeling that it's impossible to get rid of axioms and have a rock solid foundation for math, 
it was Kurt Gödel proved mathematically that there will always be unanswerable questions and unprovable statements; therefore,
Arithmetic, and thus also any system based on it, is, of necessity, incomplete. The finding is called **Gödel's 
Incompleteness Theorem**.

Russell's intuition and Godel's Incompleteness theory confirms one paramount point:  there will always be unknown 
and unanswerable question in mathematical systems, and in science and technology general which are built upon mathematics, 
echoing what Billy Graham's idea that technology can't solve human shortcomings as well.
