# A Journey To Toronto

## Xiamen
The journey began in Xiamen, 2013. As a college student facing graduation, A master's degree in the U.S., 
Canada, or Europe was an option that I considered seriously. However, after some preliminary research, 
I eliminated such an option because I couldn't afford the cost of studying abroad, even the 
relatively affordable choice of Europe. I then found a job, just like the majority of my classmates. 
Time had planted the seed, though.


## Hangzhou
Life went on,  and I was working at my next stop Hangzhou. I was satisfied with the situation:
a well-paid job at a prestigious company. I was finally relatively financially secured for the first time
in my life. I could afford to buy all kinds of stuff without hesitation; I could help the family. Parents
were satisfied because my employment earned them respect from relatives and colleagues. Grandmother was 
happy as well. I was comfortable, although overtime was part of life, and work ate up all my time. What more to expect from life? 
It was 2014.

Things have shaken dramatically during the third year of work. Overtime situation had become even crazier
for us. The average weekly work time had jumped to almost 80 hours from 60 hours due to the poor
planning of the project and sick culture, but my coworkers and I were coping with it. Roughly 7 months
after such a situation, one coworker fainted with blood while working at 11 PM. We called
the ambulance and sent him to the emergency room. The whole team was shocked by the incident, and many things
changed that night. Following the incident, management announced that we should 
move back to a 60-hour-week and no one should work more than that. Life and work appeared 
normal again, but I started to pay more attention to the deterioration of my health and the increasingly frequent 
news of engineers dying because of overtime. It was 2017.

I began to explore possible ways out of such a miserable and unsustainable situation. However, I found no
easy way out. The so-called 996 culture was popular and ubiquitous among the entire tech industry. 
My company was not bad compared to others, for my company would pay for overtime which was rare
for many small firms. However, I was determined and managed to find out two solutions: 1. work for
a foreign company; 2. Move to U.S. or Canada. I decided to adopt both keys simultaneously. I jumped to one of 
my old company's foreign competitors. Finally, I had time to exercise regularly and recover from my health situation. I had time to restudy English
and prepare for school applications. It was 2018.


## Wuhan
Came with Covid was my dream offer. I felt hope, although I was stuck and quarantined in Wuhan for almost three months. 
Though Covid brought tremendous difficulties and uncertainties to my journey, I could complete all requirements for
the study visa: financial proof, criminal record, medical exam,.etc.  It was 2020.

Unfortunately,  we had to start our term in September remotely due to Covid. Fast-forward to April 2021, and I
finally landed in Toronto, Canada.

## Toronto

It is July 2022 now. I officially graduated and received my master's degree.  

Admittedly, my time at graduate school was imperfect and compromised because of Covid. It's a pity that About 
90% of our study was online, and I may make a different decision if I had the chance to relive it.

Anyway, I am ready to move to the next phase of my life. I am looking forward to my work life in Toronto. 

## The End

Although I experienced the craziest overtime (80 - 90 hours per week) with my first employer, I am very grateful
for the company. I would rethink my time there often. As I mentioned above, at least my company paid for overtime. 
The job made it possible for me to come and study in Canada financially. I am very grateful to my mentor and 
first manager, who helped me a lot and still acts as a role model for me today on how to be a manager. 
We had good team vibes and had a lot of fun together.

Besides, my graduate time was far from perfect. However, I am also very thankful for the school, the program, and everyone
I meet. It is a brand-new experience for me: a new language, new food, new culture, new everything. Moreover,
the study has profoundly expanded my horizon, and the knowledge and wisdom I accumulate during the process will be
beneficial for the years to come.
